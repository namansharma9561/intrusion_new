The "Real-Time Intrusion Detection" project addresses the critical need for 
enhanced security measures in environments where unauthorized person and 
potential threats pose significant risks. Traditional security systems often rely on 
manual monitoring, which can be slow and prone to errors. There is a growing 
demand for intelligent systems that can automatically detect and respond to potential 
security threats in real-time, ensuring the safety of individuals and assets.
